You are running iteration 1 of an autonomous Ralph Loop build.

## Previous iteration result
First iteration — no previous context.

## Your contract (READ THIS CAREFULLY)

1. Read AGENT.md first — it is your build contract.
2. Read fix_plan.md — your prioritized task list.
3. Consult spec.md for implementation details ONLY when needed (it's 37KB — read targeted sections).
4. Pick exactly ONE unchecked item — the highest-priority one that is not marked as blocked.
5. Implement that one item completely. Do not half-finish.
6. Validate your work:
   - If Rails app exists: `bundle exec rails test` or `bundle exec rspec` (whichever is configured)
   - If setting up for the first time: ensure `bundle install` and `bin/rails server` start without errors
   - For API work: use curl to verify endpoints
   - For git transport: test clone/push operations
7. Update fix_plan.md: mark completed items with [x], add notes.
8. Stage and commit ALL your changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message"`
9. Do NOT commit broken code. If validation fails, fix it before committing.

## Environment

- macOS arm64, Ruby 3.3.7 via rbenv (already on PATH)
- Rails and bundler are installed as gems
- SQLite3 is available
- OPENAI_API_KEY is set (for embeddings)
- Git is configured, you can commit freely
- Working directory: /Users/worker/src/lore

## Rails setup (if this is early iteration and no Rails app exists yet)

```bash
rails new . --database=sqlite3 --skip-docker --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox --skip-action-text --skip-active-storage --skip-action-cable --skip-hotwire --skip-jbuilder --skip-test --skip-system-test --skip-thruster --force
# Then add needed gems to Gemfile and bundle install
```

## Output format (IMPORTANT — last line of your output must be one of these)

- If you completed the task and committed: `COMPLETED: <one-line summary of what you did>`
- If you're blocked and cannot proceed: `BLOCKED: <specific reason>`
- If all tasks in fix_plan.md are done: `ALL_DONE`

The last line of your output MUST be one of these three. This is how the loop knows what happened.
